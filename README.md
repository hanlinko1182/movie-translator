This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Local media jobs

Configure `DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL` in your local environment (see
`.env.example`), and run PostgreSQL and Redis separately. Restart the Next.js
development server after changing its environment. No service starts automatically.

Run `pnpm worker:media` from the repository root in a separate terminal. It reuses
`tsx`; the `react-server` condition lets the process load `server-only` modules.
The worker needs the same database, Redis, private storage, FFmpeg, and FFprobe
as the Next.js server.

`POST /api/movies/<database-id>/process-media` returns 202 after queue submission.
`GET` returns only job ID, state, and attempts made. Queue `movie-processing`
runs `process-media` jobs with payload `{ movieId }` and stable ID
`media-<encoded-movie-id>`.

Jobs use three attempts with exponential backoff starting at two seconds.
Permanent input failures skip retries. Movies move `QUEUED` → `PROCESSING` →
`UPLOADED`; retryable failures return to `QUEUED`, terminal failures to `FAILED`.
Progress remains zero because media preprocessing does not complete subtitles.
BullMQ checks stalled jobs every 30 seconds and allows one stalled recovery.

Completed and failed jobs are retained up to 1,000 each. Repeated submission
reuses a retained job; failed jobs return 409. After fixing a failed input, remove
that specific inactive job with BullMQ before resubmitting. Retention cleanup may
eventually permit reprocessing; audio still replaces the same private WAV key.

Enqueue holds a short PostgreSQL movie-row lock while adding the job to Redis.
Redis errors roll back the database change; a commit failure attempts to remove
the job. Workers acquire the same lock and refuse movies without a committed
queue state. This is not a distributed transaction: database outages can still
require operational status reconciliation.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
